    <h1>About: The Story</h1>
    <h2>Delia Hogan, Owner and Creator</h2>
    <p>A little about me...Well, I am a stay at home mom to a precociously wonderful 7 year old boy, and wife to the most loyal and loving husband on the planet. We live in Scottsdale, Arizona with our dogs Loki and Trevor, and one grumpy old cat named Jaron.  I am literally the only female in the house! We like to keep things simple, and We like spending time with each other in the beautiful weather we have here year round.</p> 
    <p>As for why I do what I do: I have been crafting non stop since I was old enough to hold a crayon. I enjoy a broad range of hobbies, I love learning new things and I am always in the market to add a new skill to my repertoire. I cannot, however, draw, sew, quilt, or paint proper, and I live in constant envy of those who can. I love color, and texture, dimension and design, and I thrive in creative chaos. This is what keeps me sane. This is my passion, and I want to share it with the world.
    <h2>The Journey to A Penchant for Whimsy</h2>
    <p>I have always been a creative, very right brained type of person, and I have used art as a type of therapy since I was a kid. Being crafty has literally kept me sane. Being an artist has given me so much joy on so many different levels: I love creating, I love sharing what I create, and I love making people happy just by getting one of my creations. I have always been one to give handmade rather than store bought because the time, effort and attention to details specific to the recipient's personality, needs or likes makes each gift that much more meaningful.</p> 
    <p>So, over the years I have taken on a plethora of hobbies: writing, poetry, paper crafting, scrap-booking, beading, framed art, photography, hand made decor, greeting cards, gifts, cross stitch, painting, jewelry making, digital scrap-booking and design, mixed media, art journaling, making mini albums and mini scrapbooks...you get the idea. A person with that many hobbies can only keep so much of it for herself! So, as is my nature, I shared with all my family and friends, and then with their families and friends, all the while people asking me why I was not selling my creations. I tossed the idea around in my head for years, and in the meantime I practiced my trade in crafting, taking classes to learn new things, watching endless hours of tutorials to acquire new techniques, and making the same project over and over again until I felt I had mastered the nuances of the design, and then making it my own. Gradually I did some local craft fairs where I was able to get a better idea as to how my creations would be greeted, pricing specifics, inventory management, and as a bonus I was able to network with my fellow crafty vendors and gain priceless insight into the world of selling handmade goods. I was amazed by how many people wanted to spend their money on things that I had made, and I was even commissioned a few times for custom orders.</p> 
    <p>Given all that, the next logical step for me was to start my own business. After so much more work than I expected, A Penchant for Whimsy was born, and I couldn't be happier. I love running my own shop, and sharing my passion with an endless audience, and although it has been a journey spanning decades, I still feel like this is just the beginning.</p>
